      <description>The whole project is aimed to find the mechanism of DNA recognition and catalysis for HHaI, a DNA methylase. I just participated in the beginning part to simulate DNA base-flipping use Amber 14 with an enhanced sampling method, SITS. This project gave me another perspective on researching biological systems.</description>

      <description>I began to produce data for this project from January 2017. We calculated the long-range correlation of DNA sequences of different creatures and are analyzing the different actions of diverse base-pairs, the relationship of correlation length and phase separation of chromosome, and the relationship of correlation length and gradient and biological properties like longevity and incubation temperature.
This project is supported by Beijing Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates.</description>

      <description>During summer 2018, I worked with Prof. Michael W. Deem on prediction of vaccine efficacy as a visiting undergraduate researcher at Rice University, Houston, TX.
We combined pEpitope theory with generalized NK model (both are developed by Deem&amp;rsquo;s group) in different ways and find a method to predict vaccine efficacy of H3N2 just from sequence information and statistical mechanical model. It is a pretty good prediction with an r-squared equals to 0.</description>
